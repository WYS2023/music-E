Fly firefly

When I said go I never meant away

You ought to know the freaky games we play

Could you forgive and learn how to forget

Hear me as I'm calling out your name

Firefly come back to me

Make the night as bright as day

I'll be looking out for you

Tell me that you're lonely too

Firefly come lead me on

Follow you into the sun

That's the way it ought to be

Firefly come back to me

Firefly

You and me

We shared a mystery

We were so close

Like honey to the bee

And if you tell me how to make you understand

I'm minor in a major kinda way

Firefly come back to me

Make the night as bright as day

I'll be looking out for you

Tell me that you're lonely too

Firefly come lead me on

Follow you into the sun

That's the way it ought to be

Firefly come back to me

Fly firefly through the sky

Come and play with my desire

Don't be long don't ask why

I can't wait another night

Fly firefly through the sky

Wait another night

Don't be long

Fire fire fire firefly

Firefly come back to me

Make the night as bright as day

I'll be looking out for you

Tell me that you're lonely too

Firefly come lead me on

Follow you into the sun

Oh oh

That's the way it ought to be

Firefly come back

Firefly

Firefly come back to me

Make the night as bright as day

I'll be looking out for you

Tell me that you're lonely too

Firefly come lead me on

Please come back and lead me on

Follow you into the sun

You're still

That's the way it ought to be

Firefly come back to me
